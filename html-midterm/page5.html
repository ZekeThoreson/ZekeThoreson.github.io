    <ul>
        <li>In the section that says: "Item 3", no li closing tag was provided. To fix, I just closed the element.</li>
        <li>In the section that says: "This div contains a nested paragraph", there was no closing p tag. To fix, I just closed the element.</li>
        <li>In the section that says: "Cell 3", there was no closing td tag. To fix, I just closed the element.</li>
        <li>There was no closing tr tag. To fix, I just closed the element.</li>
        <li>There was also no table element closing tag. To fix, I just closed the element.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Page 2</h2>

    <!-- Page 2 done -->
    <ul>
        <li>This page's structural error comes from the lack of tabbing used. Everything on the same tab line is bad practice and a headache to decipher. I couldn't tell where one tag ended and another began. </li>
        <li>The h6 tag that had "History enclosed did not have a closing tag.</li>
        <li>The b tag surrounding the "New Beehive Inn" was not closed properly. The end tag didnt have the /b within the carrots.</li>
        <li>The "segmental arch" within an a tag did not have a proper link, so I added one for it</li>
        <li>The "bay" within an a tag did not have a proper link, so I added one for it</li>
        <li>The h2 tag reading "Interior" had b tag surrounding the h2 tag. The b tag is an inline element so this caused an error.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Page 3</h2>
    <hr>
    <ul>
        <li>No !DOCTYPE html at the top</li>
        <li>Added lang="en" to the opening html tag</li>
        <li>Switched around all of the section tags to div tags because section tags are semantic and not necessary in the situation</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Page 4</h2>
    <hr>
    <ul>
        <li>No !DOCTYPE html tag at the top</li>
        <li>In the line containing "dogSinging.png" there was no td closing tag</li>
        <li>In the line containing "orangeCat.png" there was no td tag surrounding the image tag.</li>
        <li>In the line containg "creature.png" there was no td opening tag.</li>
